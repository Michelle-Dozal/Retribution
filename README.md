# Retribution

## Me (Michelle Dozal) Personally
Prior to this course I had never touched either Unity or C# and had ever thought about making games. The development was a total of 8 weeks using the scrum process and keeping an up-to-date log of what needed to be completed,what was in works, and what was already completed. Having another experience with the scrum process made me even more comfortable with it. I really enjoyed working on this project and looked forward to working on it. After this course I feel like I learned so much and I'm proud of what I put into this game and what I accomplished. 

## What I Personally Implemented
* Health Bar & Player Health Scripts
* Death Traps & Scripts
* Player Respawn/Replay & Scripts
* Player Health Boost & Scripts
* Save/Load functionality & Scripts (campfire)
* Music for (Player healthpickup, slide,jump,menu)
* Panels for Death Screen,Save Screen,End of Game
* etc.

## Usage
If you have unity then you can just fork & start playing/working on it in Unity. If not, then you can ask me or my team member for the executable file so you can play on your computer :)
